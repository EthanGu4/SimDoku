"""A few hand-picked puzzles used as shared test fixtures, so "easy" and
"hard" mean the same thing across every solver's correctness battery.

Deliberately separate from app/core/puzzle_bank.py: these are chosen to
exercise specific solver behavior (rejects, backtracks, sparse search),
whereas the bank is a large graded dataset the app actually serves."""
